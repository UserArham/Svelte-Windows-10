# Welcome to the Windows 10 Simulator, built with Svelte and Tailwind CSS brought by Vercel.
This is an upcoming Windows 10 Simulation built with Vercel.
The simulation is basical and does not meet the requirements ship to make an custom OS to Microsoft.
This is an mock-based simulation, so I must make it meet the Svelte requirements.
# What do you need to run it? 
To run it, you must use: 
- Windows 8 Professional or higher
- Android Version 5.0 Loilpop or higher
- iOS 6 or higher
- Ubuntu 16.10 or higher
- macOS 10.13 or higher
# This framework is not real!
The framework is by Vercel. Not real guys.
# Key note: You may fork it or copy it, but this can not become sellable. To sell in Google Sites or Canva, fork your own copy.
